#Skin Lesion Detection Using Autoencoders and Transfer Learning

Detection of skin lesions at early stages can be critical in tackling melanoma (a
form of skin cancer).With the addition of more malignant cases to our dataset,
our auto-encoder model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.3%, a recall of 91.7%, and a precision of 94.8%. These results
align closely with the baseline accuracy range of 90% to 96%. However, they
fall slightly short of the baseline precision and recall, which range from 93%
to 95.1%, respectively. Future work could focus on training our models with
datasets that are diverse across racial groups to enhance their robustness and
accuracy when used in non-caucasian populations.
